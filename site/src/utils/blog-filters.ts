// This file is not strictly necessary for the current client-side implementation
// where filtering logic is inline in the Astro script.
// It would be used if the filtering logic was more complex or needed to be shared,
// or if Astro supported client-side scripts as external modules for partial hydration.
// For now, the inline script is sufficient and directly meets the requirement.
